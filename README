At the moment this is just a GNOME panel applet that says "I love Trimet".
Future plans include making it display a countdown for a Trimet stop of your
choice and possibly (probably) an GNOME Shell extension.


INSTALL:
Run install.sh as root. I haven't actually tired this.

REQUIRES:

python 2.7
python-gnomepanel
pygtk
