At the moment this is just a GNOME panel applet that says "I love Trimet".
Future plans include making it display a countdown for a Trimet stop of your
choice and possibly (probably) an GNOME Shell extension.


INSTALL:
Run install.sh as root. I haven't actually tired this.

REQUIRES:
python 2.7
python-gnomepanel
pygtk


TODO (sort of in order of priority):
-Save preferences in a file somewhere (maybe ~/.config/trimetApplet/prefs or something)
-Update the timer every time the button is clicked
-An about dialog
-Package it into a nice .deb and upload it to a PPA.
-Allow the text to change color (ie go red) when the bus neared, as per the
	user's preference. This could also include recurring or one time alarms
	when it got below a certain number. ie. Display a notification when the
	bus is coming in 10 minutes, or schedule a notification so that every
	when the bus that is suppose to come at 5:30 is 10 minutes away display
	a notification. This could probably be extended even further.
