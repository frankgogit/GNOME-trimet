This applet displays a countdown for arrivals at the Trimet stop of your choice.


INSTALL:
Run install.sh as root.

REQUIRES:
python 2.7
python-gnomepanel
pygtk


TODO (sort of in order of priority):
-Allow the user to only watch one bus/MAX line
-An about dialog
-Package it into a nice .deb and upload it to a PPA.
-Allow the text to change color (ie go red) when the bus neared, as per the
	user's preference. This could also include recurring or one time alarms
	when it got below a certain number. ie. Display a notification when the
	bus is coming in 10 minutes, or schedule a notification so that every
	when the bus that is suppose to come at 5:30 is 10 minutes away display
	a notification. This could probably be extended even further.
